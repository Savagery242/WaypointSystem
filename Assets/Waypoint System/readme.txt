Debug controls:

- Load scene "WaypointTest"
-'T' begins traversal
- Switch paths using the '0' and '1' number keys.
- In the WPController objects (Path1 and Path2), you can toggle different groups of nodes on and off. Nodes can be assigned to groups using the WPNode inspector.
- "isLooping" causes the path to become a loop. If you want a ping-pong effect, any node that should cause a direction reversal can be set in the inspector for that WPNode.
